WS2812 Circular Light

This is a work in progress / learning exercise.

The idea is make a circular luminaire using addressable LEDs. 

It is intended to be more of an artistic feature, rather than provide general
room lighting. 

Included is an OpenSCAD file that allows the generation of the 3D models for 3d printing the frame and diffuser sections of the light.
The file is parameterised to allow for the configuration of the number of LEDs in the light, and the length of the rendered section to fit the 3D printable volume.
